# TangleNet
IOTA IXI Module to read web content from the Tangle

TangleNet on IOTA Ecosystem: https://ecosystem.iota.org/projects/tanglenet

## Setup

Setup a local fullnode and run it
```
https://github.com/iotaledger/iri
```
PS.: A few changes required on IRI are on their way. For now you need to use my iri branch
```
https://github.com/brunoamancio/iri
```

Sync the vanilla way or download the database
```
http://db.iota.partners/IOTA.partners-mainnetdb.tar.gz
```
For testing purposes only: if you download the database you donâ€™t need to keep synced, as long as your test transactions are available in the database you have downloaded.

Clone this repo in your IXI directory (/ixi which, per default, is in the same folder as your iri-*.jar)
```
git clone https://github.com/brunoamancio/TangleNet
```
That's it. The IRI should load the IXI module automatically.

You should see this in the IRI log
```
[main] INFO  com.iota.iri.IXI - Searching: ixi/TangleNet
[main] INFO  com.iota.iri.IXI - Loading module: TangleNet
[main] INFO  com.iota.iri.IXI - Starting script: ixi/TangleNet/index.js
TangleNet extension started...
```

## How to use
Option 1 - Use curl:
```
curl http://localhost:14265/ -X POST -H "Content-Type: application/json" -H "X-IOTA-API-Version: 1" -d "{'command': 'TangleNet.view', 'tail' : ''}"
```
Option 2 - Use your browser:
http://localhost:14265/?command=TangleNet.view&tail=

The tail parameter is the hash of the transaction with index 0 in the bundle with the web content.

## Examples

Hello World transaction:
```
BUUFWGXQYVHQNEDRHWLMRYWWKRGIJ9FDGQL9AA9XNSKYYPHJDIRBMJNQNGNUJXHMB9UYSQCDDJEJA9999
```
Preview:
https://thetangle.org/transaction/BUUFWGXQYVHQNEDRHWLMRYWWKRGIJ9FDGQL9AA9XNSKYYPHJDIRBMJNQNGNUJXHMB9UYSQCDDJEJA9999

This transaction will NOT work after a snapshot, since transactions are removed. You must send your own transaction to the tangle and consume it.
